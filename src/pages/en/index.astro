			<h1>🚀 Hello, I'm Maxime Violette!</h1>

			<p>
			Passionate about <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>embedded systems</strong>, and <strong>networking</strong>, 
			I enjoy designing projects that are functional, efficient, and creative.
			</p>

			<p>
			👨‍💻 On the web side, I work with technologies like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, 
			<strong>FastAPI</strong>, and <strong>Node.js</strong>. I've built several projects, including personal dashboards 
			and web games like a multiplayer <em>Spotify Game</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
			🔧 I'm also interested in <strong>embedded systems</strong>: <strong>STM32</strong>, <strong>Arduino</strong>, 
			<strong>FreeRTOS</strong>, with proficiency in protocols like <strong>CAN</strong> and <strong>RS232</strong>. 
			Electronics and low-level programming are among my favorite fields.
			</p>

			<p>
			🌐 Thanks to my knowledge in <strong>networking</strong> (Cisco, server management, DNS, domains), 
			I'm able to make my services securely accessible.
			</p>

			<p>
			🎶 Outside of development, I compose music using <strong>FL Studio</strong> with virtual synths 
			like <strong>Spire</strong>. Creativity isn't limited to code!
			</p>

			<h2>🛠️ Some Projects I've Built</h2>
			<ul>
			<li>🎧 <strong>Spotigame</strong> – A multiplayer game based on Spotify where you guess who a song belongs to.</li>
			<li>📊 <strong>Personal Dashboard</strong> – A web app to visualize my data and statistics.</li>
			<li>🔌 <strong>Embedded Projects</strong> – From STM32 peripheral control with FreeRTOS to melodies on Arduino.</li>
			</ul>
